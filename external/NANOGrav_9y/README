NANOGrav 9-year data set
Initial public release "9yv1" 2015/05/28

DESCRIPTION
-----------

  This file contains TOAs and timing solutions for the NANOGrav "9 year"
data set, covering data taken from ~2005--2013 using Arecibo and the
GBT, with both ASP/GASP and GUPPI/PUPPI backend instrumentation.  A
detailed description of the data set and timing methodology is published
as "The NANOGrav Nine-year Data Set: Observations, Arrival Time
Measurements, and Analysis of 37 Millisecond Pulsars" by Arzoumanian et
al. (2015; arXiv:1505.NNNN); this paper should of course be cited in any
use of this data set.  Further questions about the contents of this data
set can be sent to Paul Demorest (pdemores@nrao.edu) and/or David Nice
(niced@lafayette.edu).

  The current version is the initial public release, compiled at the
time of submission of the accompanying paper.  While we do not
anticipate any major changes, minor changes in the contents (eg, in
response to referee comments) are still possible.

USAGE NOTES
-----------

  With the exception of J1713+0747, all par and tim files should work
identically in both tempo and tempo2.  For J1713+0747, tempo2 requires
an alternate par file (J1713+0747_NANOGrav_9yv1.t2.gls.par).  A
comparison of results fitting with tempo and tempo2 can be found at:
http://www.cv.nrao.edu/~pdemores/nanograv_data/tempo_compare_9y.html

  This data set requires very up-to-date installs of tempo or tempo2 in
order to work correctly.  If your install of either is older than
November 2014 (tempo version 2014-11-20 76b8375; tempo2 version
2014.11.1), it should be updated from the source repositories at:

   http://tempo.sourceforge.net
   http://tempo2.sourceforge.net

  All models included here are based on a generalized least squares
(GLS) fit that includes a noise model with covariance between TOAs
(ECORR/jitter parameters; RNAMP/RNIDX red noise parameters), as well as
"traditional" EQUAD and EFAC parameters.  All noise model parameters are
included in the par files.  In order to run tempo with GLS fitting, you
must include the "-G" flag on the tempo command line.  tempo2 will
notice the presence of the relevant parameters and enable GLS fitting
automatically.  If this seems not to be working, please check that your
version of tempo/tempo2 is up to date as described above.  In tempo2, if
GLS fitting is working, you should see output lines similar to:

    Including red noise and/or ECORR parameters, calling new dofit
    Including ECORR value for backend Rcvr_800_GUPPI: 0.196088 mus
    Including ECORR value for backend Rcvr_800_GASP: 0.00795474 mus
    (...etc...)

  The clock files provided in the clock/ subdirectory need to be
installed.  Please see the README.clock file in that directory for
installation instructions.

  The release contains a file named 'stats_9y_YYYYMMDD.dat' that lists
the fit degrees of freedom (number of data points minus number of
parameters), and the non-reduced chi2 achieved with tempo and tempo2 for
each pulsar.  When starting to use this data set, or with a version
update, it is highly recommended that you compare your local results
with this table as a test that your tempo install, clock files, etc are
set up correctly.

  The extratim/ subdirectory contains sets of supplementary TOAs that
were not used in the timing and noise model fits presented here.  The
*.dmxcut files contain TOAs from observing epochs where small fractional
bandwidth prevents a useful DM measurement.  The *.cut files contain a
small number of TOAs that were manually identified as outliers.  See the
9-year data set paper for additional discussion.

  The template/ subdirectory contains all pulse profile templates used
for generation of the TOAs in this data set.  The templates are given in
PSRFITS format, and the template used for any given TOA can be
identified via the -tmpl flag on the TOA line.  See the 9-year data set
paper and also Demorest et al (2013) for a description of the algorithms
used in template profile generation.

CHANGE LOG
----------

2015/05/28 PBD Initial public release (9yv1).

2015/12/08 PBD Minor update to remove additional JUMPs from J2145-0750
               and J2214+3000 solutions; matches final accepted version
               of information in paper.  J1640+2224 par file was not
               fully converged, additional iteration was run.  Added
               alternatives/ subdir to hold versions of the data release
               modified for publications beyond the original paper, see
               README files in there for additional information.
